    Full-width 10 ft banded constructive solver.

    If the given tile set can be arranged in horizontal bands that exactly tile a 10 ft width
    (i.e., each tile width divides 10 ft, possibly after rotation), and the total area is an
    exact multiple of 10, this constructs a placement instantly.

    Returns:
        (placed, Wcells, Hcells) on success, or (None, 0, 0) if not applicable.
